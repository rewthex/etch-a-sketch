# Etch-a-sketch

This is the Etch-a-sketch project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

The goal was to create a site that operated in a similar fashion to the famous Etch-a-sketch toy.

To achieve this Javascript was used in conjunction with flex box. By starting with some basic styling with CSS the entire grid is generated with Javascript. Additionally, any changes to the grid size or coloring style is also done via Javascript.
